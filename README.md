# Introduction to R programming for data science

Dr. Francesca Finotello

## Course description

R is one of the leading programming languages for statistics and data science, with over two million users worldwide. R language is useful to carry out basic and advanced data analyses and is increasingly indicated as prerequisite for job positions in life science and biomedicine.

In this course you will learn the basics of R through lectures and hands-on computer exercises. You will familiarize with the R language and console, as well as with concepts like variables, data types, and data structures. Examples and practical computer exercises will be used to introduce you to the basics of R programming for data science, including how to: manipulate and visualize data, perform calculations, read and write files, run and repeat specific analytical tasks using functions and control statements. 

## Prerequisites

This course is aimed at people who would like to start using R. Previous experience in programming languages or data science is not required.
